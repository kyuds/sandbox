# experimental
This is the repository that houses all experiments and practices that I do to integrate into various coding projects and improve my skills in computer science. Sometimes, building something into a developing project may introduce additional difficulties to see if a particular algorithm or method is fully functional. Therefore, experimenting with the ideas in a smaller environment can be worthwhile.
